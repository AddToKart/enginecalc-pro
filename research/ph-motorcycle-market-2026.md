# Philippine Motorcycle Performance Market Analysis (2026)

## **1. Market Overview**
The Philippine motorcycle customization scene is dominated by the "low displacement, high performance" philosophy. The underbone (raider) and scooter (click/mio) segments drive the majority of aftermarket sales. "Bore-up" culture is central, with standardized milestones (e.g., "59 all stock", "63 VVA").

### **E. Engine Internals (Crankshafts)**
"Stroker" kits increase displacement by lengthening the piston travel.
*   **Specs**: +1.5mm, +3.0mm, +4.5mm (Pin lift).
*   **Con-Rods**: Forged connecting rods (e.g., IKK, TRF) to withstand higher compression.
